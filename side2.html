                <h3>FORT DOUAUMONT</h3>
                <p>
                    Built following the Franco-Prussian wars, this fort acted as a shelter for locals during the Battle of Verdun. 
                    However, in the confusion, it was soon captured and destroyed by the Germans. 
                    Today, it remains one of the least changed of the World War 1 sites, with visitors able to see it as it was at the end of the war.
